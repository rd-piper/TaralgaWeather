## Summary of Project
Describe the files in each directory in the Readme.md file.
To try the project, download and unload the zip file of the project and then load the TaralgaWeather.Rproj file into [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com). The "cheat sheet" for RMarkdown can be found [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) (from the URL it seems that they are using Wordpress to host their web site). RStudio contains a Git client, but this may not work on the Intranet.
